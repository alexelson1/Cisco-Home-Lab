Attached are screenshots and text files of my networking home lab which I used for my CCNA.

I created this using Cisco Packet Tracer

The txt files represent all of the running configs for the networking devices. 

I used a 3 tier network topology which can be seen in the CCNA Lab jpeg file.

Feel free to go through each text file to examine each running config for each device.

I also added a screenshot from PC1 in the network to show its connectivity.

Not screenshotted is the config to the WLC. This is because the GUI for the WLC is very limited and there really are only a few configurations that can be made due to the limitations of packet tracer.

It is shown however that the wireless AP are working which you can see in the CCNA Lab JPEG file
